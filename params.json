Written specifically for OS X Dovecot mail servers.\r\nHigh mailbox counts on default boxes ( INBOX, Sent & Deleted ) can degrade mail server performance quickly and as we all know you cannot rely on users to keep their boxes properly maintained. **_epicArch_** will allow you to quickly archive these boxes into a very easy to follow structure. Users are automatically subscribed to their archived folders and the mail remains fully searchable via the chosen mail client. When used with a crontab it makes mailbox maintenance almost automated. Can be called with -h for options and examples. \r\n\r\n`bash <(curl -Ls http://git.io/DHmBhA)`\r\n\r\n***","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
